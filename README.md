# Quadratic Equation Solver

This is a console application for solving quadratic equations.
You can solve quadratic equatations in this app in 2 modes (interactive, non-interactive)

Clone and build this project on your local machine using this script:

```
git clone https://github.com/lekoaa/mtrpz-lab1.git
cd mtrpz-lab1
```

Then you can choose one of the modes: interactive or non-interactive

If it's non-interactive, then you need to run the script with the path to the file instead of <path>


```
py main.py <path>
```

If it's interactive, then you need to run
```
py main.py
```
